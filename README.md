# Stable-Gait-Optimization-for-Small-Sized-Humanoid-Robot-Using-CFO

This research proposes a new way to optimize the gait
design for human robots that allows stable stepping with preset
foot-lifting magnitude. The novel Central Force Optimization
(CFO) algorithm is used to optimize the gait parameters to help
humanoid robot walk steadily. The efficiency of the proposed
method is compared with the GA-Genetic Algorithm, PSOParticle
Swarm Optimization and improved differential
evolution algorithm (MDE-Modified Differential Evolution).
The simulated and experimental results applied on the smallsized
humanoid robot show that the newly proposed algorithm
offers an efficient and stable gait for humanoid robots with
accurate foot-lifting magnitude.
